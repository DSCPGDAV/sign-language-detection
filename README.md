# sign-language-detection
### what it does?
This model basically decript the sign showing to it to the alphabetic letters(A,B,C,.....a,b,c,.....) so that people who don't understand the sign language can understand it. 
### Benefits:
American Sign Language (ASL) is a complete, natural language that has the same linguistic properties as spoken languages, with grammar that differs from English. ASL is expressed by movements of the hands and face.
so the people who are deaf can understand the english language.
	The people who don't know about hand sign language find it difficult to understand this languag. This model provide them with some ease in doing so by decripting the hand and face sign into meaning sentences and letter.
